# Portfolio

#### This is the portfolio of Osman Muglu. It contains several projects related to data engineering and programming. For full functionality using jupyter notebook is recommended.

#### All projects within this portfolio are done using Python, SQL, Spark and different tools within Microsoft Azure. 

#### Programming and data engineering:

### <b>Project 1 - Data scraping, databases and Flask applications:</b>

<b>Project 1.1 - Flask App - Task Master:</b> In this project we built Task master applicaton using Flask for your daily to-do list. . Witin this project we used Python, SQLalchemy (database), HTML and CSS.  In this application you can add, update and delete items within your to-do list. The data that is used on the website goes through the database. 

<b>Project 1.2 - Wheather data:</b> Within this project we mine the wheather data of Google. For this a python code is wirtten in order to get elements from the wheather data on Google. 

<b>Project 1.3 - Lunch database and table:</b> Here we create a database and table. Also we fill this table with data. In this project we used python and Sqlite 3. 

<b>Project 1.4 - Price comparison:</b> In this project we scrape data from different websites and save in a database. In order compare the prices of the product we get the data from the database and analyse it. For this project python and Sqlite3 is used. 

<b>Project 1.5 - Random beer app:</b> Within this project a random beer generator app is build. In order to built it data has been scraped from a website. In this project we used python and HTML. 

### <b>Project 2 - PySpark and SparkSQL:</b>

<b>Project 2.1 - Friends Data:</b> In this project a CSV data file is loaded and read using spark. The data is put into a dataframe in order to run an SQL query over it. 

<b>Project 2.2 - Data by age:</b>A CSV data file is loaded and read using spark in this project. In order to get the results we used spark(sqL) functions in order to group, aggregate and sort the data.

<b>Project 2.3 - Total amount:</b> for this project we used spark to read and load data into a spark dataset. In order to get the results we used spark(sqL) functions in order to round, sum and sort the data.

<b>Project 2.4 - Movies!:</b> Within in this project we use two different data files. To do this we use broadcast variable and user defined function. 

<b>Project 2.5 - Most popular super hero:</b>In this project we use two different data files. For one file we create a schema and for the other a dataframe. With the use of these files we extract the data we need through ID's. 

### <b>Project 3 - Azure Data Factory:</b>

<b>For this project a data platform is build for reporting and prediction of covid-19 outbreak. Data is ectracted, transformed and loaded from a HTTP source and a file within Azure blob storage. In this project sevral data pipelines have been setup in order to schedule data movement and transformation activities. Also, in this project I show CI / CD skills. In this project I used Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Data Flow, and Azure DevOps.</b>
